Testing different hyper-parameters for different types of model. I intent this repo as a reference to find which hyper-parameter works good in which setting.


### Network types to benchmark
- [ ] Autoencoders(linear, variational, convolutional)
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] Sequence models
- [ ] Graph networks
- [ ] Structured data
- [ ] Time series

### Planning to cover
- [ ] Weight Initialisation
- [ ] Activation functions
- [ ] Learning rate
- [ ] Batch size
- [ ] Optimisers
- [ ] Regularization (subset weight decay)
- [ ] Epochs (subset early stopping)
